# Clipboard Enhancement for NVDA

## Introduction

Clipboard Enhancement is an add-on for the NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) screen reader. This add-on is designed to enhance the functionality related to the clipboard and the text last spoken by NVDA. It aims to improve the user experience by providing more control and flexibility over the clipboard content and the text spoken by NVDA.

## Features

The add-on offers several features, including:

- **Copy Last Spoken Content**: Allows users to copy the content last spoken by NVDA to the clipboard.
- **Append Last Spoken Content**: Users can append the last spoken content to the existing clipboard content, instead of replacing it.
- **Paste Last Spoken Content**: This feature enables users to paste the last spoken content directly to the current cursor position.
- **Line-by-Line and Word-by-Word Viewing**: Users can view the content of the clipboard in a more detailed manner, including line-by-line and word-by-word navigation.
- **Additional Features**: The add-on also provides other functionalities such as one-click URL opening, viewing the lunar calendar date information, and notifications when the clipboard content changes.

## Internationalization Support

Currently, the Clipboard Enhancement add-on does not have internationalization support. We welcome users who speak languages other than Chinese to try this add-on, but the experience might not be optimal.

## Future Plans

We are planning to provide internationalization support in future releases to allow more NVDA users to benefit from this add-on. 

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the Clipboard Enhancement add-on, especially in areas such as code optimization and preparation for internationalization support. If you are interested in contributing, please feel free to submit a Pull Request (PR) on our GitHub repository.
